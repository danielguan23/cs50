Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The time taken to simulate does not increase linearly at small number of simulations but increasesly more exponential with larger simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 10000 simulations, the percentage chance of winning stabilises, thus 10000 simulations will be minimum to be good enough.
